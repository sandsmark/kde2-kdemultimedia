SketchAmp v1.1
==============
Skin for WinAmp 1.8 (and higher)

Unzip these files into the <WinAmpDir>\Skins\ directory,
and don't forget to recurse subdirectories.
Press Alt+S in WinAmp and choose the "Sketch" WinAmp skin.

Distribute this freely, but please do not alter the files.

By the way, this was for fun. :P

A note to prospective skin creators:
One thing that confused me was where the minus sign comes
from for the Time Remaining display.  This comes from the
middle of the 2 in numbers.bmp.  So when you make a skin,
make sure you line up your graphics perfectly.
