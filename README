What it is
----------

* noatun: a multimedia player for sound and moview, very extensible due to
it's plugin interface
* aktion: a player specialiced on movies, needs xanim
* kmid: a standalone and embeddable midi player, includes a karaoke-mode
* kmidi: midi player, can use sound patch files and create a WAV file
* kmix: the audio mixer as a standalone program and Kicker applet
* kscd: a CD player with an interface to the internet CDDB database

The following are libraries and plugins that are building the core infrastructure
of above applications:

* arts: a versatily multimedia system the consists of various little
building blocks that you (or an application) can combine in almost arbitrary
ways to create sound and video processing pipes
* mpeglib: a library for MPEG 1 (layer I, II and III) encoded files
* mpeglib_artsplug: wrapped mpeglib to make it Arts-aware
* mpg123_artsplugin: a trimmed down mpg123 made Arts-compatible
* oggvorbis_artsplugin: support for ogg-vorbis (not included) in Arts

Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 2.1.0 or newer.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.
