  this should be very useful in editing objects with lots of properties
  (widgets)
- add icons for all modules
- make _changed signals visible so you can connect the value_changed of a
  poti to the frequency of a filter
- make it possible to edit parent property of widgets (i.e. to insert one
  widget into another)
